    if (d.getElementById(m)){return;}
    js = d.createElement(h); js.id = m;
    js.onload = function(){init({ribbon: topright})}

    fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs)
  }(document, "script", "dhm"))
</script>
```

4. Your should see the Don't Hunt Me popup ðŸ™Œ

### Host it yourself

If you prefer, you can implement directly in your app.
The easiest way for now is to simply copy/paste the content of `dhm-ribbon.js` in a JS module.
If you only want the blocking popup without the ribbon, use the `dhm.js`script.

The donthuntme image is loaded from donthuntme.com. If you wish to lad it from your server, download donthuntme.png, put it in your root server folder and change `var host="donthuntme.com"` with your domain.

Let me know if you think of a better way!
